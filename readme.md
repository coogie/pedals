# Pedals (https://coog.ie/pedals)

An exploration of the Web Components and the Web Audio API by building out various guitar effects pedals as modular components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the repo, simply clone it down and install dependencies ([Yarn preferred](https://yarnpkg.com/en/))

```bash
$/pedals> yarn install
```

and run:

```bash
$/pedals> yarn start
```

The application is hosted on Github pages and, as such, the build task generates a static site into the `/docs` folder.
To build the app for production, run:

```bash
$/pedals> yarn build
```
